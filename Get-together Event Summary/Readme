# 📊 Get-Together Event Summary Dashboard (Microsoft Excel)

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Event planning often involves multiple expense categories, donations, and cost allocations that can easily become overwhelming without proper tracking. After organizing a get-together party, I realized the importance of managing costs, understanding expense distribution, and comparing actual spending against the budget.

This dashboard was designed to visualize these insights and showcase how Microsoft Excel can be used for event financial analysis and reporting.

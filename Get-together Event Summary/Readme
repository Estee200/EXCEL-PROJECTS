 Get-Together Event Summary Dashboard (Microsoft Excel)
 Problem Statement

Event planning often involves multiple expense categories, donations, and cost allocations that can easily become overwhelming without proper tracking. After organizing a get-together party, I realized the importance of managing costs, understanding expense distribution, and comparing actual spending against the budget.

This dashboard was designed to visualize these insights and demonstrate how Microsoft Excel can be used for effective event financial analysis and reporting.

 Objectives

This project was designed to:

Track total expenses, donations, and guest-related costs in one place

Compare actual spending versus budgeted amounts across major categories

Analyze donation types and contributions (cash, gifts, and services)

Identify top cost drivers and expense categories

Build an interactive dashboard with month-based filtering

Present insights using a clean, storytelling-driven visual layout

 Insights & Findings
1️⃣ Budget Utilization

Total actual spending reached ₦2.5m against a ₦3m budget, indicating strong cost control.

2️⃣ Top Expense Categories

Hall and Logistics & Services were the highest cost drivers.

Food-related expenses (meat, rice, oil, spices) accounted for a significant share of total costs.

3️⃣ Donations

Cash donations made up 84% of total contributions, providing strong liquidity.

Non-cash donations (gifts and services) accounted for 16%, helping reduce overall cost pressure.

4️⃣ Cost Efficiency

The average cost per guest was approximately ₦10,000, which is reasonable for a 250-person event.

5️⃣ Category Analysis

Venue (32%) and Attire (30%) consumed the largest portions of the budget.

Legal and Printing expenses had minimal impact, each contributing less than 5%.

 Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be leveraged beyond basic spreadsheets to deliver meaningful financial insights for real-life events through structured data, interactive filters, and well-designed dashboards.

Get-Together Event Summary Dashboard (Microsoft Excel)

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Event planning often involves multiple expense categories, donations, and cost allocations that can easily become overwhelming without proper tracking. After organizing a get-together party, I realized the importance of managing costs, understanding expense distribution, and comparing actual spending against the budget.

This dashboard was designed to visualize these insights and demonstrate how Microsoft Excel can be used for effective event financial analysis and reporting.

OBJECTIVES
This project was designed to:
Track total expenses, donations, and guest-related costs in one place
Compare actual spending versus budgeted amounts across major categories
Analyze donation types and contributions (cash, gifts, and services)
Identify top cost drivers and expense categories
Build an interactive dashboard with month-based filtering
Present insights using a clean, storytelling-driven visual layout

DATASET INFORMATION
Source: Personal event expense tracker (self-collected data)
Format: Excel table
Rows: Approximately 80 transaction records
Columns: Category, Item, Cost, Budget, Month, Donation Type, Guest Count

TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES
Microsoft Excel: Dashboard design and visualization
Slicers: Month-based filtering
Design Techniques: Color-coded KPI cards, Doughnut charts, Category icons

DASHBOARD HIGHLIGHTS
KPI Cards:
₦2.5m Total Expenses
250 Invited Guests
₦1.7m Donations
₦10k Cost per Guest

Charts & Visuals:
Bar chart showing Top 10 Expense Categories
Doughnut chart comparing Budgeted vs Actual Expenses
Pie chart showing Donation Distribution by Type (Cash, Gift, Services)
Category-wise expense percentage visuals with custom icons (Attire, Catering, Legal, Printing, Venue)

INSIGHTS & FINDINGS
1. Budget Utilization:
Total actual spending reached ₦2.5m against a ₦3m budget — showing strong cost control.

2. Top Expense Categories:
Hall and Logistics & Services were the highest cost drivers.
Food-related expenses (meat, rice, oil, spices) made up a significant share of total costs.

3. Donations:
Cash donations accounted for 84% of total contributions.
Non-cash donations (gifts/services) accounted for 16%, helping reduce overall cost pressure.

4. Cost Efficiency:
Average cost per guest: ₦10,000 for a 250-person event.

5. Category Analysis:
Venue (32%) and Attire (30%) consumed the largest portions of the budget.
Legal and Printing expenses had minimal impact (<5%).

KEY TAKEAWAY
This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be leveraged beyond basic spreadsheets to deliver meaningful financial insights for small- to medium-scale events, using structured data, interactive filters, and well-designed dashboards.

📊 Get-Together Event Summary Dashboard (Microsoft Excel)
🧠 Problem Statement

Event planning often involves multiple expense categories, donations, and cost allocations that can easily become overwhelming without proper tracking. After organizing a get-together party, I realized the importance of managing costs, understanding expense distribution, and comparing actual spending against the budget.

This dashboard was designed to visualize these insights and demonstrate how Microsoft Excel can be used for effective event financial analysis and reporting.

Track total expenses, donations, and guest-related costs in one place

Compare actual spending versus budgeted amounts across major categories

Analyze donation types and contributions (cash, gifts, and services)

Identify top cost drivers and expense categories

Build an interactive dashboard with month-based filtering

Present insights using a clean, storytelling-driven visual layout

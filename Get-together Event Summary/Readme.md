#  Get-Together Event Summary Dashboard Using Microsoft Excel

##  Problem Statement

Event planning often involves multiple expense categories, donations, and cost allocations that can easily become overwhelming without proper tracking.  
After organizing a get-together party, I realized the importance of managing costs, understanding expense distribution, and comparing actual spending against the budget.  
This dashboard was designed to visualize these insights and showcase how **Excel** can be used for event financial analysis and reporting.
